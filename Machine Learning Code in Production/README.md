# Coding Best Practices

**Key Concept**

- Refactoring : the process of writing code that improves its maintainability, speed, and readability without changing its functionality.

- Modular : the logical partition of software into smaller programs for the purpose of improved maintainability, speed, and readability.

- Efficiency : using the resources optimally where resources could be memory, CPU, time, files, connections, databases, etc.

- Optimization : a way of writing code to be more efficient.

- Documentation : written material or illustration that explains computer software.
Linting - the automated checking of your source code for programmatic, syntactic, or stylistic errors.

- PEP8 : a document providing guidelines and best practices for writing Python code.
