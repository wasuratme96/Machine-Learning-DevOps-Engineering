# Instructions
In this exercise we will write an inference pipeline.

The starter kit contains a main script that drives the pipeline (``main.py``) and a 
``random_forest`` component that you will complete.

You have to open the ``run.py`` script within the ``random_forest`` component, then go to the
function ``get_inference_pipeline`` and complete all the missing pieces (further 
instructions are in the file).

Once you are done, you can run your RandomForest with:

```bash
mlflow run .
```

Make sure to checkout the ``config.yaml`` file to understand what dataset are being used, as well
as all the other default parameters.
